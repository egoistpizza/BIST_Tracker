# BIST Tracker

BIST Tracker is a Python project designed to scrape and store real-time stock data from Borsa Istanbul (BIST). It periodically retrieves data from a specified URL and saves it into a CSV file for further analysis or integration with other systems.

## Installation

To use BIST Tracker, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/egoistpizza/BIST-Tracker.git
   cd BIST-Tracker

2. Install the required Python packages. It's recommended to use a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

1. Run the main.py script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   
   This will start the data scraping process. The script will fetch stock symbols, daily changes, and prices from the specified URL and store them in a CSV file (BIST.csv).


2. The data will be updated every 5 minutes (300 seconds) by default, as specified in the script (time.sleep(300)). You can adjust this interval according to your needs.
